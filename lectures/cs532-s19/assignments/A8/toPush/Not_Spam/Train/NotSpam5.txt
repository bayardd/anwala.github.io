Dear Monarch Family,

My name is Isaiah Lucas and I have the distinct privilege and honor to serve as your Student Body President at Old Dominion University. The key to a successful community is an agreed upon set of values that we live by during our tenure here at ODU.  I think a symbolic representation of those values is the "Monarch Crown".
I am pleased to announce that the Student Government Association (SGA) has worked to restructure the Monarch Creed, which will now be referred to as the Monarch Crown. This will serve as the official set of values that we commit to uphold as Monarch Citizens.
Below is the Monarch Crown, and I want EVERYONE to get excited about it! Read it and live by it. If we as a Student Body can unite together and live by these values, we can make Old Dominion University a better place.
As a member of the Monarch Family, I inherit a crown.
I will wear this crown as a sign of my commitment to responsibility, engagement, and pride.
Through the royalty of my crown, I will commit to and reach goals that help me own my Monarch Experience.
This crown I wear is unique with jewels of different sizes to reflect the inclusive and diverse campus of which I am a part.
By wearing this crown, I dedicate my time to take the initiative to use campus resources to expand my crown with knowledge and devote myself to personal success.
I will wear this crown with pride knowing that I can contribute to the success of myself, my peers, and ODU.
SGAâ€™s goal is to engage as many students as possible. Your contributions to educating your peers about the Monarch Crown are helping us as a student body create a new campus-wide movement and that alone is something to get excited about. To join the movement and commit to the Monarch Crown, please complete the petition at the following link.
