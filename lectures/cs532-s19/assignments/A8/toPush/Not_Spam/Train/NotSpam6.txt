PREREGISTRATION is April 1-5 -- Are you ready?

Dear David:

Time tickets were updated March 27. Preregistration for Fall 2019 begins Monday, April 1! Are you ready?

BEFORE PREREGISTRATION BEGINS
Check for holds: See "View Holds" in LEO Online (future holds will only show up there) or "My Status Alerts" at my.odu.edu (holds display beginning on their effective date).
Advising: Be sure your advisor has moved your degree-planning hold to a future date so you can preregister on time.
Create your registration plan: Fall courses are available for viewing and planning now, in LEO Online XE Registration. You may also import your locked plan from Degree Works.  
For tips on selecting online course sections, getting overrides or overloads, and using waitlisting, see our Registration FAQ.
View your time ticket: In LEO Online XE Registration, click on Prepare for Registration, then select the Fall 2019 term. Your time ticket shows you the earliest day and time you may register. Your time ticket is also available in the University Portal, and your advisor can view your time ticket on myODU during your advising meeting.

Once pre-registration begins, register as soon as your time ticket permits!
