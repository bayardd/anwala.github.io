Hello amazing people,
 
Did you know that the Mane Hub – space across from the U Center – was created to celebrate our Monarch diversity and not a study space?  Did you know that the Mane Hub has a room specifically to honor the international student community and to use for gatherings and also promote the richness of various cultures on campus?  I have learned that many are not aware of the space and its intended usage.
 
On Monday, April 1st, OIR will be bringing back Inspirational Mondays from 12:00 – 1:30 p.m.  and we are inviting your organizations and friends to gather together in the Monarch Hub for food, fellowship and positive energy.  We will also take a tour of the space that represents the international and interfaith communities.  This will be very important because I wish for you to share your thoughts and suggestions on how we can make the space more inviting.
 
We want to show the international community that ODU appreciates you and all the diversity, intelligence, and community that your presence brings to our school! So, please join us next Monday, April 1st to celebrate our Monarch diversity and have conversations about utilizing the space in the MANE Hub of Webb Center for students of different faith traditions. Refreshments will be provided.
 
Date: Monday, April 1
Time: 12 -1:30 p.m.
Location: MANE Hub, Webb Center (1st floor Webb Center across from U-center)
