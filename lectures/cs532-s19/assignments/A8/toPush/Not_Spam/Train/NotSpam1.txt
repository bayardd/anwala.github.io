Dear Colleagues:

I write first to invite your participation in creating an exhibit featuring the people of ODU. Photographer Glen McClure will be on campus during three days in April to photograph ODU students, staff, and faculty outdoors and at random in his distinctive street-portrait style. The resulting exhibit will reflect the rich diversity of ODU and will be shown in the Gordon Art Galleries during the coming academic year. Please look for Mr. McClure and his camera during these windows of time:

 

-          April 16: 9 a.m. – 1 p.m.

-          April 18: 11 a.m. – 3 p.m. (Kaufman Mall during activity hour, 12:30 – 1:30 p.m.)

-          April 23: 2 – 6 p.m.  

-          April 25: Rain date if needed

 

Follow Arts@ODU on Facebook or Twitter for any scheduling changes.

 

Secondly, Arts@ODU and the Virginia Arts Festival are pleased to offer a limited number of free tickets to ODU students, staff, and faculty for select Virginia Arts Festival performances. Attached please find a flyer containing details about the offer, and visit www.vafest.org for information about the events.
