TART PLANNING FOR FALL REGISTRATION NOW!

Dear David:

Preregistration for Fall 2019 classes is April 1-5! Are you ready?
Fall 2019 classes and time tickets for preregistration will be available for viewing beginning March 1, in LEO Online XE Registration (Browse for Classes and Prepare for Registration). It's not too early to start planning!
Preregistration is offered to currently registered degree-seeking students, and time tickets are required. Your time ticket will show the earliest day and time you may register.
After March 1: To view your time ticket: In XE Registration, click on Prepare for Registration, then select the Fall term. 
Time tickets will be updated again March 28 to pick up any late-posted credits or transfer credits.
Check View Holds in LEO Online to see when your advising hold goes into effect (most advisor holds take effect April 1).
Make your advising appointment early (before your time ticket) so you can register when your window opens. Your advisor must update the advising hold to a future date before you can register.

PLAN YOUR SCHEDULE IN ADVANCE

Use the Plan Ahead feature in XE Registration to create and save up to three registration plans, or import a Degree Works plan. Once your time ticket opens, you can use one of your plans to register.
BEFORE PREREGISTRATION BEGINS
Log in to my.odu.edu to review your Degree Works evaluation before you meet with your advisor.
Update your curriculum plan in Degree Works.
Build your schedule and plan in XE Registration so you're ready when preregistration begins. Your active, locked Degree Works plan will show up in XE Registration Plans.
For questions about overrides, overloads, selecting online course sections, and waitlisting, see the Registration FAQ.
Once preregistration begins, register as soon as your time ticket permits!
Please let us know if there is anything our office can do to assist you as you pursue your studies at ODU.
Sincerely,
Enrollment Services Team
