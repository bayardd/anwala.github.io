SPRING 2019 WITHDRAW DEADLINE APPROACHING

Dear David:

This e-mail is a reminder that the deadline to withdraw from any Spring 2019 semester-long course is Tuesday, April 2, 2019.

You can use LEO Online to withdraw unless you have a hold preventing registration.

If you have a hold, you may submit a completed Add/Drop/Withdraw form to our office in person or by email. Or, you may email with your University ID number and the SUBJ/CRSE# and CRN of the course from which you want to withdraw. Your request must be received by the deadline.

CONSIDERATIONS

Are you

Receiving financial aid or scholarship? You should consult your financial aid counselor before you withdraw from any course. Your course withdrawal could impact current and future semester financial aid.

Using GI Bill benefits? Withdrawing may impact your GI Bill benefits. If you have questions about the impact of a withdrawal, please contact before the deadline.

International student? You should consult the Office of Visa and Immigration Service Advising (VISA) at intlstu@odu.edu before withdrawing from any class. Course withdrawal could affect your visa status.

In some cases, withdrawal could delay your graduation. If you are planning to withdraw from one or more courses, please consult with your academic advisor if you are not sure of the impact on your academic progress.

Additional questions to consider can be found on the Registrarâ€™s Office website.
                                                 
Sincerely,
Enrollment Services Team
Office of the University Registrar
