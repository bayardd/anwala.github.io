Greetings Monarchs,
 
I hope that your semester is going well! As the semester is coming to a close, we only have a few trips left in Spring 2019. In order to keep this program running semester after semester, transportation requires participation from the student community. So, if you would like to support this program (and of course, get some groceries), please arrive in front of the Diehn building (by the VIP parking lot) at 9:30 am on Sunday.  Take this opportunity to enjoy one of the many free services that the university offers to try and make you feel just a bit more at home. Or even use it as an opportunity to make some new friends!
 
If you would like to know more details, please visit the link below which also contains information about other transportation routes that the school offers.
  
Time: The shuttle leaves the pickup location (VIP Lot) at 9:30am for each trip
Dates:  3/31, 4/14 & 4/28 (ALL Sundays)
Hope to see you there!
