Dear Old Dominion Community:

 

On Friday morning, I woke up as we all did, to learn of the shocking tragedy in New Zealand, where 49 people were murdered and dozens of others were injured at a mosque. Words cannot give voice to this horrific mass shooting and its terrible impact on Muslim communities around the world. We must condemn this horrific and inhumane act of terrorism.

 

I know the Monarch community joins me in expressing our profound and deepest condolences to the families of the victims. We at Old Dominion support our Muslim community as we all try to comfort each other in the wake of this painful event. 

 

The Muslim Community of Hampton Roads along with the ODU Muslim Student Association will be holding a vigil on Monday, March 18 at 6 p.m. on 49th Street at the Islamic Center. Our community is invited to participate and support our Muslim students, faculty, staff and community members.

 

If any students need support, we encourage them to call the Old Dominion University Counseling Center at 757-683-4401, call the Student Outreach and Support at 757-683-3442 or email 

 

Sincerely,

 

John R. Broderick

President
