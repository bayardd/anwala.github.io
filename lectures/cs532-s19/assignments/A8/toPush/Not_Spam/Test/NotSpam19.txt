Dear David:
 
Congratulations! You have been invited to membership in the Old Dominion University chapter of The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi, the nation's oldest, most selective, and most prestigious all-discipline honor society. Standards for election to Phi Kappa Phi are extremely high. Membership is by invitation only to ODU"s top 7.5 percent of second term juniors and the top 10 percent of seniors and graduate students.
 
In  joining, you become one of a distinguished group. Our members have served in the White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court of the United States. They have won Nobel Prizes, Pulitzer Prizes, and numerous other national and international awards for service and achievement in their chosen fields. Phi Kappa Phi is proud to include among its membership thousands of men and women who, for more than a century, have sought to make a difference in the communities where they live and work.
 
Phi Kappa Phi members are eligible for one or more of the Society's awards. Phi Kappa Phi's Fellowships for graduate study, Love of learning awards, and Literacy Grants all are worth exploring. The society is proud of its record of helping members advance their education and serve their community through these programs.
 
For your membership fee of $60, you will receive a certificate of membership, a Phi Kappa Phi pin, national and local dues for one year, a one-year subscription to the Phi Kappa Phi Forum magazine, and access to members-only resources and benefits. These benefits include access to nearly $1 million in grants and awards each year; an online resume posting service; virtual seminars from career advancement experts; members-only discounts from Dell, JPASS, AT&T, Enterprise Rent-a-Car, and The Princeton Review; and much more.
