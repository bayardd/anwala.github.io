A Flexible, Affordable, and Top-Ranked MBA

The Global MBA from Macquarie Graduate School of Management (MGSM) — recently ranked the #74 MBA program in the world by the Financial Times — offers a uniquely flexible and affordable program thanks to its “stackable” design.

Tuition is due on a pay-as-you-go schedule: you only pay for the courses you take, at the time you start taking them. This means if you have to take a break from classes, or scale down the number of units you are taking, your tuition payments take a break or scale down as well.

To earn your Global MBA, you will complete 24 units, with tuition at AU$1,375 for each unit. Here’s an example of what tuition might look like for a variety of program schedules:

Accelerated full-time mode
1 year (24 units per year / 4 units per term)
AU$33,000/year

Regular full-time mode
1.5 years (16 units per year / 2 — 3 units per term)
AU$22,000/year

Part-time mode
3 years (8 units per year / 1 — 2 units per term)
AU$11,000/year

With the Global MBA, you can tailor the program to match your schedule and budget.

Get Started There are two entry pathways to the Global MBA: direct admissions (same admission criteria as the MBA program), and a groundbreaking Performance Track option. 

The final admission deadline is 8 April, 2019.
