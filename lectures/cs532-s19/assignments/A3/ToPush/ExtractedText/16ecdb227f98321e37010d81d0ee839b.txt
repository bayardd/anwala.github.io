Product Description
This New England Patriots Utility Multi-Tool isn’t just a handy gadget to have around the house, or a great collectible gift for fans of the football team. It’s also a bit of a metaphor for the team itself. Let us explain.
You see, the New England Patriots has one of the best histories all of NFL. They’ve rounded out all categories, making them good at defense as well as offense. Their sound strategies and outstanding roster has made them sort of a “multi-tool” kind of team that adapts to any situation. This multi-tool adapts to pretty much any situation, just like the Pats.
Need a screwdriver? This handy little gadget has a Philips head and a flat head. How about a bottle opener? Yes sir. Pocket knife? For sure. What about a wood saw. Abso-freakin-lutely. It even has a needle-nose pliers, an Imperial ruler and a wire cutter. Oh and did we mention it has the Patriots’ logo on the side? It has that too. It has everything but the darn kitchen sink on it!
