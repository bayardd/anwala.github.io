Hear From Happy People We've Worked With
We love working with these people and we want to share some feedback they've shared with us.
âLetâs Talk Science have been curating videos for STEM audiences for many years and only had the capacity to publish one or two a week. Since we started working with Vubble, we are sharing far more relevant, timely, reviewed, and appropriate video in classrooms across Canada â in both English and French.â
Stephen Lippa, Director, Digital Programs, Letâs Talk Science
âWe are blown away by what Vubble has been able to do. Our fans didnât have a reason to come to our site before. Now they do. Weâre excited by what that means for us and our sponsors.â
Gregory Brown, Co-Creator, AsapSCIENCE
âTeachers come to IdÃ©llo because they know it's a safe environment to source their videos for the classroom. We trust Vubble to provide us with safe, curated, quality educational content that we offer on the platform.â
Laurence Desrosiers-GuitÃ©, Chef des Contenus Ãducatifs, Apprentissage NumÃ©rique, TFO
