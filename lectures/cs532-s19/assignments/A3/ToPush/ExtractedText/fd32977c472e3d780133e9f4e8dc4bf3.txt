The Detroit Lakes girls basketball team needed a confidence boost after losing big at Moorhead Tuesday and got it in a dominating performance to down Park Rapids in Mid-State Conference action at Ralph Anderson Gymnasium Thursday, Feb. 14.
The Lakers opened up a 29-14 lead late in the first half and continued to press toward the Panther hoop culminating in a Lauryn Manning three-pointer at the buzzer for a 45-28 halftime lead.
The first time the two teams met it was all Park Rapids in a 62-39 blowout on Jan. 10.
The Lakers average 53 points scored per game but eclipsed that in the first half and scored a season-high 81 points thanks to five shooters in double figures.
Breanna Price led all DL scorers with 24; Emily Larson had 14; Manning and Alex Bettcher each scored 13 points and Ellie Lunde had 10.
Rilee Michaelson had a game-high 26 points for Park Rapids (12-7, 5-4). Kaisa Coborn added 24 as the duo scored 77 percent of the Panthersâ€™ points.
DL evened their Mid-State mark at 4-4 and are 10-13 overall heading into a non-conference road game at Dilworth-Glyndon-Felton (14-8) Friday, Feb. 15.
