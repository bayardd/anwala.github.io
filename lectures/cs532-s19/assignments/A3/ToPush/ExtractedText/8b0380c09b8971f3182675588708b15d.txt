WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will receive an update on border security legislation agreed to by Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Thursday morning, a White House official said.
Trump has not said if he planned to sign the legislation that averts a second federal government shutdown, despite encouragement to do so from his fellow Republicans in Congress. “The president is going to get an update this morning,” the official said.
