Hong Kong : HANG SENG INDEX (.HSI) optimism over U.S.- China trade talks and a new deal to avoid a government shutdown
Investors were caught by surprise by a report showing that U.S. retail sales fell by 1.2% in December, the largest single-month decline since 2009 and well below the flat growth expected by economists polled by MarketWatch. That came at the same time that jobless claims showed an unexpected rise in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits.
Stock-index futures had risen ahead of those numbers amid optimism over U.S.- China trade talks and a new deal to avoid a government shutdown. Reports had indicated that President Donald Trump may extend the tariff truce with Beijing by another 60 days if a trade deal appears near, Bloomberg News reported.
Trump has described talks, among the biggest concerns for market participants, as going “very well.” However, some observers are expecting only a limited trade deal to come to fruition, particularly if a March deadline isn’t extended.
Meanwhile, Trump was expected to sign border-security legislation, which would avert a partial government shutdown.
Earlier, reports on Japanese gross domestic product matched market expectations, while Chinese exports and imports were better than expected, as German growth numbers stagnated, painting a mixed picture of the state of the international economy.
The U.S. producer-price index fell by 0.1% in January, lower than the 0.1% increase expected by economist polled by MarketWatch.
Business inventories dropped 0.1% in November, according to a report delayed by the partial government shutdown.

Candlesticks

During the past 10 bars, there have been 9 white candles and 1 black candles for a net of 8 white candles.  During the past 50 bars, there have been 31 white candles and 19 black candles for a net of 12 white candles.
A spinning top occurred (a spinning top is a candle with a small real body).

Three white candles occurred in the last three days.  Although these candles were not big enough to create three white soldiers, the steady upward pattern is bullish.
