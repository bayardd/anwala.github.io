With the trade deadline fast approaching, we continue our look at teams around the NHL. Where do they stand, what do they need to do, and what assets do they have to fill those needs?  As we continue previewing the Atlantic Division, here is a look at the Montreal Canadiens.
Montreal has been one of the bigger surprises this season. After their summer activity, many expected the Canadiens would be battling for draft lottery seeding, but instead, they’re in the mix for a top-three spot in the division. Instead of being sellers, the Canadiens may try to add to their roster.

Trade Chips
GM Marc Bergevin has stated he is open to taking on a bad contract to bring in other assets, similar to what he did when the team added winger Joel Armia from Winnipeg in late June last season in exchange for taking on (and buying out) goalie Steve Mason ’s contract.  That’s not the most appealing of trade chips but it’s likely the Canadiens will be trying to make a similar move this season.
In terms of players that could be available, Montreal has been tinkering with its defense corps.   Jordie Benn is likely the most appealing player available as a veteran who can play a third pairing role on both sides with a fairly cheap $1.1M cap hit.  If the team adds someone else in its top-four, it could potentially turn around and trade Benn.  
It was interesting that the Flyers had to retain on Christian Folin ’s contract in their trade last weekend to bring him down to the league minimum AAV of $650K. Considering the Flyers didn’t need the extra cap room, they could flip him. Karl Alzner is available if a team wants to exchange under-performing big contracts, but with a $4.625M cap hit, that’s going to be tough.
Up front, the Canadiens aren’t likely to tinker with more than the fringes of their roster. They’ve added a couple of players already in Dale Weise and Nate Thompson , which has put winger Charles Hudon ’s future with the Canadiens in question. Hudon's agent stated earlier this season that while Hudon would like to stay in Montreal, he’d also like to play regularly. Despite collecting 30 points in 72 games last season, that doesn’t appear likely when the Canadiens are fully healthy.  
With a $650K cap hit, Hudon could be an intriguing buy-low candidate for a cap-strapped team and it appears the asking price has been set at a mid-round draft pick.

Team Needs
1) Left side defense: The Canadiens have been lacking a top-pairing left-shot defender since Andrei Markov left. While Victor Mete , Mike Reilly , and Brett Kulak have played well at times, that left side is not strong enough. Finding someone to log considerable minutes would give Montreal a safety net for a postseason push while potentially elevating the play of Shea Weber or Jeff Petry .
2) Power play help: Although Montreal is in the middle of the pack when it comes to scoring, its power play has been an issue all season. That shouldn’t come as much of a surprise considering the Canadiens dealt their two top natural scorers in the offseason. Finding a way to upgrade play with the man advantage would help their chances. Accordingly, it wouldn’t be shocking to see them try to bring in a second-line winger with a track record of success on the power play.
