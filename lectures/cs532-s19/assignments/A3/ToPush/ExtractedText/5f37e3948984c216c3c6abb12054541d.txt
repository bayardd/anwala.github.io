Donald Trump to declare national emergency over border wall
President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency in order to build his wall. But there’s another key reason he’ll never admit to.

It’s official. Donald Trump will declare a national emergency over the US-Mexico border crisis to score the $US5.8 billion he wants to build his wall.
The White House has confirmed the President will make the official declaration as he signs the government funding bill, which just passed the US Senate.
“President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.
“The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.”
A national emergency is an official declaration issued by the President to give himself special power to deal with a crisis.
In this case, it will allow Mr Trump to use defence funds to pay for the wall — which he’s long campaigned for to reduce immigration numbers — without needing congressional approval.
He said that the move would give him power to divert money from other budget projects into wall building.
The Senate has approved the bipartisan spending deal by a massive 83-16 margin.
The deal will not provide the full $US5.8 billion Mr Trump is after, but contains $US1.3 billion for additional border security. The bill will now go to the House.
WHY TRUMP WENT FOR THE NUCLEAR OPTION
Donald Trump has long campaigned for a border wall on the US border to keep out South American immigrants and asylum seekers.
In his State of the Union address last week, he doubled down on his push for funding, stating: “Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.”
But experts say this has less to do with the alleged “humanitarian crisis” and a lot more to do with politics.
Speaking to news.com.au this morning, Dr David Smith from the United States Studies Centre said Mr Trump is desperate to reaffirm the support of his conservative base before the next election.
“The reason Trump is doing this is because he is desperate to convince his base and the people who voted for him in 2016 that he is getting all this money to build a wall,” he told news.com.au.
Over the past few months, a number of high-profile conservatives turned on Mr Trump over his perceived backdown on the border wall.
Right-wing pandit Ann Coulter deemed Mr Trump “the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States”.

“He’s doing this to save face with them,” said Dr Smith. “He’s also doing it because he knows he needs everyone he had in the 2016 election to come out and vote for him again. He hasn’t particularly expanded his support base … and he believes this is the best way to keep his own supporters angry and motivated.”
Dr Smith said there is “objectively no crisis” at the border, noting that the number of undocumented immigrants to the US has been falling since 2008.
“In 2000, there would be over 1.6 million apprehensions at the border every year. Now there’s less than 300,000.”
DEMOCRATS ISSUE FURIOUS RESPONSE
Various high-profile Democrats have issued a furious response to the declaration.
Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Ms Pelosi warned Republicans Mr Trump is setting a precedent where a future Democratic president could declare gun violence a national emergency.
“If the president can declare an emergency on something he has created as an emergency, an illusion that he wants to convey, just think about what a president with different values can present to the American people,” she said.
“You want to talk about a national emergency? Let’s talk about today,” she added, referring to the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that saw 17 people killed exactly a year ago.
Ms Pelosi said the shooting was “another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America”.
“That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that an emergency Mr President? I wish you would. But a Democratic president can do that. A Democratic president can declare emergencies as well,” she said.

Ms Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer later issued a joint statement about the planned declaration, describing it as “lawless”, a “gross abuse of power” and “desperate”.
“Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall,” the statement said.
“It is yet another demonstration of President Trump’s naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the president’s fearmongering doesn’t make it one.
“He couldn’t convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he’s trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it.
“The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.”
A number of high-profile Democrats have echoed their remarks.
Senator Kamala Harris, who is running for president in the 2020 election, described Mr Trump’s wall as a “vanity project” and said declaring a national emergency was “ridiculous”.
Declaring a national emergency over this President’s vanity project is ridiculous. We don’t need a wall. Instead, we should address the actual emergencies facing our country â everything from gun violence to the opioid crisis.
â Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 14, 2019
Senator Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 contender, similarly said Mr Trump’s “ridiculous” wall is “not an emergency”, citing gun violence and climate change as issues that would be worthy of one.
Gun violence is an emergency.
Climate change is an emergency.
Our country’s opioid epidemic is an emergency.
Donald Trump’s ridiculous wall is not an emergency.

Asked whether the Democrats would file a legal challenge, Ms Pelosi said she was certainly considering it.
“I may. That’s an option,” she said. “We will review our options. We will prepare to respond appropriately to it.”
Ms Sanders said the Trump administration was “very prepared” for a legal challenge, adding that there “shouldn’t be” one. “The President’s doing his job,” she said. “Congress should do theirs.”
US President Donald Trump says national emergencies are common.
TRUMP LIKELY TO FACE LEGAL CHALLENGES
It’s highly likely that Mr Trump will face legal challenges as this moves along.
Dr Smith noted national emergency declarations are usually reserved for large-scale issues that are forced to go beyond Congress, like natural disasters and terrorism.
“Previous national emergencies have been all about war and natural disasters — things that are widely recognised as national emergencies, where Congress doesn’t have time to deliberate. That’s what they’re there for,” he said. “To use it for a purpose over an issue that has been debated for months, where Congress has specifically rejected what he wanted to do, is unprecented, and will certainly face legal challenges.”
He also said it will prompt a debate over whether the border issue really constitutes an emergency, noting that — while a number of Republicans are prepared to go along with Mr Trump on the issue — several have voiced their opposition.
Several conservatives appear to be fearing it will set a precedent for a future Democrat president to use on conservatives down the track.
“The Republicans are worried that if it succeeds — obviously Trump won’t be President forever, and a Republican won’t be President forever — so what happens when a Democrat comes in and declares a national emergency over climate change, or gun control, or the opioid crisis?” said Dr Smith.
Since this morning’s announcement, some Republicans have already expressed their concern. In a statement, Republican Congressman Chris Stewart said the President was “making a mistake”, warning the national emergency would “set a dangerous precedent”.
“I think President Trump is making a mistake by declaring a national emergency in order to increase border funding. Whether the President has the authority or not, it sets a dangerous precedent and places America on a path that we will regret.
“It deeply worries me that a future Democratic President may consider gun violence or climate change a ‘national emergency’ and what actions they may then take.
“While I agree we must secure our borders and provide increased security, we must limit the power of the Executive to make such declarations.”
Dr Smith said Republicans will overall be supporting the declaration “very reluctantly”.
He also noted it won’t sit well with the American public, which have held concerns about rising executive power over the past century. The national emergency declaration is a continuation of that trend.
Polling has repeatedly shown that Americans oppose a national emergency declaration — including more than 25 per cent of Mr Trump’s own party.
A CNN poll issued this morning saw 66 per cent of respondents opposing the declaration, and a Fox News poll released last week showed 52 per cent opposed.
HOW COMMON ARE NATIONAL EMERGENCIES?
Mr Trump has made numerous threats to call a national emergency in recent months.
The President has the power to declare such an emergency, but by definition, it refers to any occasion in which “federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States”.
With Democrats controlling the lower house now, the move could bring about a constitutional crisis.
Mr Trump has previously tried to make the move sound quite ordinary.
“You know, we already have national emergencies out there. You know, President Obama, President Clinton, President Bush — they’ve declared many national — this is not unique. They’ve declared many national emergencies. Many, many,” he said earlier this week.
But the emergency action Mr Trump has announced is a rare one.
The presidents he cites did not use emergency powers to pay for projects that Congress wouldn’t support.
Emergency declarations by Mr Obama, Mr Bush and Mr Clinton were overwhelmingly for the purpose of addressing crises that emerged abroad.
Many, for example, blocked foreign interests or terrorist-linked entities from access to funds.
Some prohibited certain imports from or investments to countries associated with human rights abuses.
“It’s extremely rare for a president to declare a national emergency in a bid to fund domestic construction projects, particularly one that Congress has explicitly refused to fund,” said Andrew Boyle, an lawyer in the national security program at the Brennan Centre for Justice. “The ones that former presidents declared are of a different sort.”
With Congress unwilling to give Mr Trump anything close to the $US5.7 billion he wants to build a portion of the border wall, the White House has made clear that he would seek money from other sources, whether with an emergency declaration or by other means.
Altogether, Mr Clinton declared 17 national emergencies, Mr Bush, 13, and Mr Obama, 12, according to a list compiled by the Brennan Centre.
