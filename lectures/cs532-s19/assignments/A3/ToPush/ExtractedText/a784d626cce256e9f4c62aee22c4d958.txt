Emmaus High School boys basketball coach Steve Yoder has a different feeling about this yearâs edition of the Green Hornets.
And he hopes that evolves into a championship feeling on Saturday night.
The second-seeded Green Hornets led the whole way during a 61-55 victory over sixth-seeded Allen in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference semifinals at Parkland High School on Thursday night.

The Green Hornets reached three championship finals during the summer, during the Cedar Beach Showcase, A-Town Throwdown and Allentown Summer League. After coming up short in those finals, the team is ready to claim some gold when it matters the most.
âI learned that this team is really hungry and they want more. Weâve been blessed to have some good teams in my 11 years here. But, I just get a different vibe from this team â that this team doesnât want to settle,â Yoder said. âWeâre obviously going to have our hands full â¦ I do think the summer galvanized them â¦ Finishing second three times did leave a sour taste in everybodyâs mouth, including the kids. I think weâre going to embrace Saturday and have fun with it. Iâm just having the best time Iâve had in my 11 years here, with this group.â
A 3-pointer from Ethan Parvel gave Emmaus a 12-1 lead with 3:43 remaining in the first quarter. A layup by the senior with less than a second to play in the first half pushed his teamâs advantage to 29-17 at the break.
âWe owned the game plan. The kids have been really good with that all year. We wanted to make sure they didnât dribble-drive us to death â our one- and two-pass-away help was outstanding,â Yoder said. âWe knew they were going to double Mark (Swedberg) and Zach (Sabol) in the post. I thought our ball movement was equally fantastic. We swung the ball, got the defense loose and everybody attacked the basket.â

Allen (14-9) cut the Hornetsâ advantage to 55-50 with 1:27 remaining in the fourth quarter. Emmaus, however, put the game out of reach with a 6-2 spurt.
âYoder told us that our senior leadership needed to matter in that situation, which it did, in my opinion,â Swedberg said. âWeâre just tired of taking second place. We went 0-3 this summer. Weâre really trying to make a statement: that stops now.â
Parvel and Bryce Diehl both finished with 14 points. Swedberg added 12.
âBryce was just outstanding tonight. I thought Ethan attacked the basket. Cameron (Brooks) managed the game for us in so many ways; Danny Bohman came in, as well. I thought our guards were outstanding,â Yoder said.
Nate Ellis and Emmanuel Ozuna tallied 14 points apiece for the Canaries.
