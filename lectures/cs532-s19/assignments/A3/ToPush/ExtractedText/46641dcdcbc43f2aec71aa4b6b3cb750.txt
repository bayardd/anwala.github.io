The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports the photo taken from Johnson's Instagram account showed him wearing a charcoal facial mask for skin care.
Port Washington High School Principal Eric Burke didn't say what the consequences would be but he apologized for the students' actions and said they also would offer "a sincere apology." He says he thinks the students didn't understand how the display would be construed but the school still will "make this right."
The 6-foot-8 Johnson, who averaged 18.4 points and 9.6 rebounds a game last season as he helped Sun Prairie go 25-2, announced on July 29 that he and his younger brother Kobe were transferring to Nicolet.
