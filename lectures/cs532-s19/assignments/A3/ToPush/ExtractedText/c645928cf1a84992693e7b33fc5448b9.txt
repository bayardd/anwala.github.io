The Nascar season gets going this weekend with the great american race, the Daytona 500 down in Florida.
A year ago, Austin Dillon won his first Daytona 500 in the famed Number Three car, twenty years after Dale Earnhardt won it.
The 28 year old driver is an up and coming star in a sport, and he should be a fan favorite for the fans back in South Dakota.
One of Dillon's main sponsors is Sioux Falls based POET and Growth Energy.   And he told us today what that partnership means to his team
"POET and Growth Energy both have been with me seems like from the beginning. You know we've won races together in Xfinity, even won the Eldora Truck Race together with American Ethanol.  They've been a great partner and I feel like having Growth Energy in our sport is huge.  So many miles have been ran on E-15 and it's so special to have them and represent them on and off the track because ethanol is so important to the growth of the US"  says Dillon.
Dillon is looking to become the fourth driver ever to win back-to-back Daytona 500s.
