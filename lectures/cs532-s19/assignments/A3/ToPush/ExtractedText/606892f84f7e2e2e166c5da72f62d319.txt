GOLF NOTES: Steve Stricker riding to Ryder Cup rescue?

LOS ANGELES — Tiger Woods met with the media on Wednesday at Riviera Country Club ahead of the Genesis Open and, like everything in the world nowadays, it got political.
Woods was asked about a recent photo posted on social media showing him playing a round of golf with U.S. president Donald Trump and golf legend Jack Nicklaus. The journalist wanted to know how well Trump played, adding that “apparently he’s been playing a lot of golf over the last two years.”
Woods wasn’t biting though.
“President Trump has been very busy up in D.C., hasn’t played a lot of golf, hasn’t had the tan from playing outside, he’s been working,” Woods said. “We just had a great time.”
The 14-time major champion was also asked about news reports that he turned down an invite to play in last month’s Saudi Arabia International. Other high-profile players have faced some social media criticism for playing in the European Tour event.
“I turned the opportunity to go to Saudi Arabia down last summer. It was well before anything had transpired,” Woods said, likely referring to the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Dustin Johnson, winner of the Saudi Arabia International, was also asked about his time there.
“Obviously I enjoyed it. I won,” Johnson said.
If anyone thought they were going to get anything political out of Johnson, they were barking up the wrong tree.
“Nice hotel, food was good and the golf course was just fine. I mean, that’s really all I’m looking for when I’m going somewhere.”
