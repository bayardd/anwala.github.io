Activision is looking to refund the base-game purchases of people that picked up Guitar Hero Live in the last year or so of its lifespan. The company has rolled out a voluntary refund program that aims to issue refunds to those players that picked up the game after December 1, 2017.
No reason for this particular cutoff date or the refunds themselves is given, but the refund offer comes just months after Guitar Hero TV, the service that gradually cycled new playable songs in the game, was shut down for good .
That feature was officially sunset on December 1, 2018 after roughly 3 years up and running. Guitar Hero Live players still have access to any of the songs that were offered as on-demand titles, but Guitar Hero TV was the primary way Activision brought new content into the game and worked as more of an ever-rotating playlist of content than a traditional DLC model.
With that live service sunset, any of the hundreds of songs offered during GHTV’s lifetime are completely inaccessible. Even before the official shut down, new songs had stopped appearing on the service and the studio behind the game, FreeStyle Games, itself suffered layoffs before being essentially picked up and rebranded by Ubisoft as Ubisoft Leamington.
