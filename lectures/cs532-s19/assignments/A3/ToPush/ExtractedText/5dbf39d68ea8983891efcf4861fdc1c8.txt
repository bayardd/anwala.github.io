Expands the Alternatives to Detention program from 82,000 to 100,000… so instead of housing family units at the border- they get moved into the interior where they almost always stay in the country permanently.

– 55 miles of bollard fencing, which is to say, vehicle barriers:
– The vehicle barriers are specifically limited to the Rio Grande sector of the border:

– This area was chosen because local Democratic governments will have the power to veto construction:
Here is the provision that appears to give local officials authority to block. Remember, the authorization to construct is only in the RGV of Texas. The RGV is some of the most liberal counties in the entire country (wonder why?). pic.twitter.com/yN2hXUppUR

Thus, they brilliantly limited the wall to just the area with liberal politics and then gave them veto power. For example, if they would do this in Cochise County, AZ, local officials would obviously support the wall. But this bill doesnt authorize wall there.

– The bill offers TWICE as much for refugee assistance as for the potential vehicle barriers:
Refugee Assistance — $3.4 billion, which is $73 million above the FY2018
enacted level and $632 million above the President’s budget request.
MORE THAN DOUBLE THE MONEY FOR THE WALL, HOORAY!!!!!!! https://t.co/CrMvezkQia

Oh it gets even better, the $1.37 billion allocated for “physical barriers” only allows “fencing designs in use as of 2017.”
Oh and super epic: “prohibits construction on sensitive environmental areas”
Wow, great job fellas. I’m glad the plants and animals will be ok! pic.twitter.com/jytSRIMSSR

– The bill forbids Trump from building anything resembling the border wall prototypes that were built in California:

They can only be used to make steel bollard design… no concrete wall, no prototypes. Same thing as what Bush and Obama built… just a little bit taller pic.twitter.com/2jn2arTOWk

– The bill expands catch and release by cutting ICE detention beds:
The bill DOES expand Catch and Release by reducing the number of border beds from 49,060 to 40,520

– The best part is that Israel, Jordan and Ukraine receive $5.3 billion – nearly 5x what the GOP Congress is willing to spend on our own border.

– Trump also gets less money for “border security” than he did in the 2018 Omnibus.
After signing the Omnibus Spending Bill last March, President Trump said he would never sign another bill like it again. The 2018 Omnibus Bill allocated only $1.6 Billion for “border security.” The deal put together by Congress this week allocates $1.3 Billion.

– The bill DOUBLES H2-B visas for unskilled, agricultural workers for Big Ag:
This spending bill will ensure that not a single mile of fence will be built. (Any sort of "wall" is directly prohibited.) https://t.co/wIyxInCn3l

The bill is great for Israel though … so, will he sign it? Will it be America First or Israel First? Mitch McConnell is saying he is ready to sign it.
