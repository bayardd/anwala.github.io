FARGO -- The North Dakota State men’s basketball players put on social media Thursday various video versions of “Roses are Red, Violets are Blue” Valentine’s Day poems. There were some lines that were pretty thoughtful.
On the court, Bison junior Jared Samuelson turned Oral Roberts red with a parade of 3-point field goals -- initially to open the game and then to close it -- and the Bison were all roses for the fifth straight game. The 85-73 victory at Scheels Center at Sanford Health Athletic Complex before 1,880 fans improved NDSU to 8-4 in the Summit League and 14-12 overall.
The Bison used the long ball to do it, hitting 15 of 27 from 3-point range. It was one short of the school single-game record of 16 set three times, the last in 2002 against Mayville State.
“Our energy level has been a lot higher, it’s been through the roof and it starts in practice,” Samuelson said.
Samuelson, who hit 6 of 9 treys and finished with 18 points, was part of an early 3-point binge that gave the Bison a lead they would never lose. He ended ORU’s comeback hopes with back-to-back treys that took a precarious 73-70 lead to a nine-point advantage in a matter of 30 seconds.
“I was trying, I left a lot short tonight,” said Samuelson, whose interpretation of “a lot” was actually missing four shots. “I was getting angry so I had to stroke it through and my teammates found me.”
The first 10 minutes was uncommon in college basketball. The Eagles, starting with a 2-3 zone before quickly switching to a 1-3-1 look, played a cat-and-mouse game of defending the 3-pointer. It’s something they usually do, but the Bison were ready for it.
“They made 3s,” said ORU head coach Paul Mills.
Not a lot of teams in the Summit have been able to do that.
“We’re the second-best defensive team in the league, so no,” Mills said.
NDSU’s first 21 points were the result of 7 of 9 shooting from beyond the arc. It wasn’t until Tyson Ward’s reverse layup with 11:21 left did the Bison get a regular field goal and it was 26-14.
Adding to the oddity? Play was continuous. The first media time out, ordinarly the first stoppage of play under 16 minutes, didn’t happen until 10 minutes remained. That’s about when ORU switched to a man-to-man defense and normal-looking basketball resumed.
Still, the Golden Eagles shot 62 percent in the first half, yet trailed 46-38 at halftime. They didn’t cool off in the first several minutes of the second half, either, hitting five of their first eight shots to pull within three.
The Bison responded with a couple 3-pointers from Tyree Eady and three hoops in less than three minutes from Ward, the latter a one-handed tip-in that made it 71-63 with 6:12 left. Kevin Obanor’s basket for ORU from in close cut it to 73-70 with 4:10 remaining.
“We cut it to 73-70 and Jared Samuelson makes two back-to-back 3s and that’s the ballgame,” Mills said.
Samuelson was sick last week and lost 13 pounds, said head coach Dave Richman.
“You could see the life back in him and the energy today and it was terrific to see,” Richman said.
Point guard Vinnie Shahid continued his fine play of late leading the Bison with 22 points. He was 4 of 6 from 3-point range and, more impressive, didn’t commit a turnover in 36 minutes of play.
Ward finished with 18 points and 8 rebounds and Eady was a fourth player in double figures with 10 points.
“This was a big game, this game was really high on my radar,” Richman said. “This is a good team playing well that we played against and I liked the way our guys came out focused and locked in.”
