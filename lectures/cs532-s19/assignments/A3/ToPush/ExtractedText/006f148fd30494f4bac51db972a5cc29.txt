PIKEVILLE, Ky. -- UPIKE men’s basketball will have to have short memories after suffering a tough loss on Thursday to Shawnee State, 102-97.
For the second time this season, Shawnee State couldn’t miss against the Bears. SSU shot 58 percent from the floor and a staggering 96 percent (26-27) from the free throw stripe. Shawnee scored 63 points in the second half to erase a four-point halftime deficit.
UPIKE shot the ball almost equally well at 52 percent over all, but Shawnee State took eight more free throws and made nine more.
Shawnee State was able to take over late with its dominance and size inside. Starting forwards EJ Onu and Justin Johnson each scored 24 points to lead the team. SSU shot 74 percent inside the three-point line.
With 17 minutes left to go, Shawnee went on a 12-2 run to take its first lead in the second half. From there, UPIKE got within one possession, but a later 10-3 run got it in back to a nine-point lead and UPIKE couldn’t get back in striking distance.
However, all was not lost on the night as with the other results in the Mid-South Conference, UPIKE has secured at least a tie for second place in the conference.
UP NEXT
UPIKE will have the weekend off before a brutal final week, going to Georgetown on Thursday with first place in the MSC on the line, then hosting Campbellsville on Saturday for senior night.
