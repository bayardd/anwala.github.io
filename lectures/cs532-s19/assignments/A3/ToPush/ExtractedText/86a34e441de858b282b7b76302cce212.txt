LESS THAN 36 HOURS LEFT TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT
Lay it out for all to see:
Last night, lawmakers released a bill to fund the government and prevent another partial shutdown.  http://bit.ly/2SSXRtt
When Congress will vote to keep the government open: The Senate will vote on the bill this afternoon. Then the House will take up the bill this evening.  http://bit.ly/2SByiOn
Just now — a change to the House schedule: "NO votes expected in the House on Friday so long as Senate & House pass border deal/funding package tonight, according to lawmakers & aides in both parties. Trump expected to sign it before midnight Saturday to avert shutdown." (Via The Hill’s Scott Wong)  http://bit.ly/2GIRAtQ
What the bill includes: $1.375 billion in funding for physical barriers along the border. Keep in mind: Trump has demanded $5.7 billion in border wall funding. 
Is Trump expected to agree to the deal?: So far, yes. But Trump did say he is "not happy" with the deal, so stay tuned.  https://cnn.it/2DC9njf

To ruffle some feathers: "To try to slow things down, the far-right House Freedom Caucus rolled out a one-week stopgap funding bill, or continuing resolution (CR), to buy lawmakers more time to read the bill — an effort that will be ignored by Democrats who control the floor."  http://bit.ly/2SByiOn
Mood at the Capitol yesterday: "Border deal negotiators Henry Cuellar (D) & Chuck Fleischmann (R) were just hugging and laughing while they joked w/ reporters…" (Via Politico's Melanie Zanona)  http://bit.ly/2DH56LD
