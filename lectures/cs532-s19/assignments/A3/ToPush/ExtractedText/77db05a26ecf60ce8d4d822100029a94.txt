21 Savage was granted release on bond this week after being arrested on February 3 by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The rapper appeared on âGood Morning Americaâ today (February 15) for his first interview since the arrest. Watch the full interview below.
21 Savage tells ABC Newsâ Linsey Davis he was âdefinitely targetedâ by officials. When Davis asked Savage what happened the day of the arrest, he said: âI donât even know, I was just driving and I just seen guns and blue lights. And then I was in the back of a car and I was gone.â When she asked if authorities told him he was under arrest, Savage replied âNah, they didnât say nothing. They just said, âWe got Savage.ââ
Davis later references 21 Savageâs âFallonâ performance of â a lot ,â in which he rapped about immigration (âBeen through some things so I canât imagine my kids stuck at the borderâ). âDo you feel like you were targeted as a result of that, basically being critical of the immigration system here?â Davis asks. âMy lawyers think that,â 21 replies. Adding his own opinion, 21 says, âI donât really know. I canât really say. I would see why people would think that, but I really canât say.â
21âs attorney Dina LaPolt also appeared on âGood Morning America,â explaining, âWe are in the middle of securing his immigration status, so where heâs a citizen, but itâs very, very complicated, and thereâs a lot of steps that we have to go through.â Alex Spiroâthe lawyer that JAY-Z hired for 21 âadded, âWe believe, honestly, that he was targetedâof course, like they saidâand part of the reason, we think, is both because heâs a celebrity, and they can use this as a way to send a message, and also, perhaps, because of his music.â
21 Savageâs legal team released a statement on his behalf this week. âHe will not forget this ordeal or any of the other fathers, sons, family members, and faceless people, he was locked up with or that remain unjustly incarcerated across the country,â the statement reads. âAnd he asks for your hearts and minds to be with them.â
ICE claimed that 21 was a âUnited Kingdom nationalâ who âis unlawfully present in the U.S.â After the arrest, the rapper confirmed via representatives that he was born in the United Kingdom. Contrary to ICEâs claim that he first came to the United States in 2005, 21 Savage said he arrived when he was 7 under an H-4 visa, departed in 2005 to visit the United Kingdom, and returned that same year. His representatives claimed 21 lost legal status in 2006 âthrough no fault of his ownâ and was attempting to obtain another visa when he was arrested by ICE.
