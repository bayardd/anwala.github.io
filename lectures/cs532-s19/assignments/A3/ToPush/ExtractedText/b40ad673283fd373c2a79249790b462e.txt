As another government shutdown looms, talk of a general strike has once again begun picking up steam. While the idea was discussed during the longest-ever government shutdown , it’s on some folks’ minds again as the temporary funding bill that reopened the government is set to expire on February 15. While The New York Times has reported that, on February 11, lawmakers reached a deal “in principle” by agreeing to provide over $1.3 billion for the construction of border fencing, there is a general strike already in the works for February 16.
“Imagine the power of working people standing together to demand that our government work for us,” the group General Strike 2019 writes on its website . “If the shutdown continues, we call on all Americans to join us on February 16th at our nation’s airports to show what workers united can achieve.”
“Led by courageous aviation workers, whose lives and livelihoods are endangered if the shutdown continues, we will come together and demand that Washington stop playing political games with our safety and security,” the message continues. “Together, we have the power to end this nightmare for millions of Americans and demand a government that works for all of us.” The impacts of the government shutdown have been intense for many.
There can’t be a general strike without folks getting the word out. Enter Cher: the Emmy-, Grammy-, and Oscar-winning actress, singer, and all-around entertainment icon. When she’s not busy making a Mamma Mia sequel shine, the 72-year-old is a Twitter fanatic rivaling President Donald Trump — but with a very different set of priorities. For instance, she joined the call for a general strike in a tweet Monday.
