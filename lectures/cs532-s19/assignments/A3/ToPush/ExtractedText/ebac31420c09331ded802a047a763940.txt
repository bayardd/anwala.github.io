It's a different classification, but the same old playoff look for the Canyon Lady Eagles.
That's bad news for everybody else.
In their Class 4A area round matchup with Andrews on Thursday at Lubbock Christian University, the Lady Eagles cracked the 70-point barrier for the second straight game. And for the second straight playoff game, they routed their opponent, rolling to a 73-20 victory to reach the region quarterfinals.
Canyon (25-6) will play the winner of Friday's game between Lubbock Estacado and Mountain View, with the winner advancing to the Region I-4A tournament back at LCU.
This game was pretty much a continuation of Monday's 70-30 win over Dalhart in the bidistrict round. It's an indication that Canyon's offense is getting into gear at the perfect time.
"I just felt pretty much through the whole game we executed pretty well," Canyon coach Joe Lombard said. "(Scoring over 70 points two straight games) is unusual for us. We've shot the ball extremely well and that was the common denominator for us."
The most common denominator for the Lady Eagles has been senior Brylee Winfrey. For the second straight game, she led Canyon in scoring, as she had a game-high 19 against Andrews (10-23), almost equaling the Lady Mustangs by herself.
Chloe Callahan added 10 points for Canyon, who had 13 players enter the game and score.
 
Andrews 3 10 16 20
Canyon 18 39 54 73
A—Paige Ortiz 6, Makayla Ross 6. C—Brylee Winfrey 19, Chloe Callahan 10. Records; Canyon 25-6, Andrews 10-23.
