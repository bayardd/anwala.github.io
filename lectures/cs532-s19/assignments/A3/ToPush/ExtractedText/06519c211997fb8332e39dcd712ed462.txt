DC walking on eggshells -- will Trump sign bill to avert shutdown? 07:23
(CNN) â€” Nearly nine weeks after the government shut down, Congress has finally reached agreement -- and cleared the path forward to pass -- on a package that will clear the decks on spending battles, and most importantly, spending deadlines, until the end of September.
In the form of 1,169 pages, the full spending package -- which is comprised not just of the border security agreement, but also the six remaining outstanding funding measures, is now public and ready to be voted on.

That much, according to aides and both parties, in both chambers, is virtually assured at this point. The question remains will President Donald Trump sign the deal, which, at least on Capitol Hill, everyone is working under the assumption he will. But as everyone should be well aware by now, nothing is final until the President puts pen to paper on the bill.
With that in mind, just a word of caution: This is a very large piece of legislation, released at midnight, less than a day before the final vote Thursday, with a Friday deadline.
