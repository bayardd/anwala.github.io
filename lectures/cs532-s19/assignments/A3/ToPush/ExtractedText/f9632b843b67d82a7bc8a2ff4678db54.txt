What Needs to Happen: Wisconsin
The Illini have a chance to beat the Badgers for the first time since 2011. The Fighting Illini last saw the Badgers less than a month ago at the State Farm Center on Jan. 23. But a lot has changed since Illinois’ 72-60 defeat in its last encounter with Wisconsin, and this match up at the vaunted Kohl Center promises to be much more competitive.  Here’s how the Illini can come home with a victory on Monday and extend their current win streak to five. Contain Ethan Happ Illinois actually did a fairly good job at this in their most recent meeting, as they held Happ to 9 points and 9 rebounds. They’ll need at least a repeat performance if they want to have a chance in this game. Happ exploded for 20 points and 12 rebounds in the Badgers’ previous game, which was a home loss to No. 12 Michigan State, and he’s currently averaging a double-double with 18.4 PPG and 10.5 RPG. However, he’s only shooting 44.5% from the charity stripe on the season, and went 0-6 in his last game. Giorgi Bezhanishvili and Adonis De La Rosa will have their work cut out ...

Scouting Report: Wisconsin Badgers
Illinois can look for revenge over Wisconsin.  Your Illinois Fighting Illini are currently one of the hottest teams in the Big Ten, if not the country. Winners of four straight and five out of the last six, Underwood and Co. look like absolute world beaters. Now, another big test awaits this young team as they travel to Wisconsin.  What will the red hot Illini need to prepare for against an angry Badgers team? Limit Ethan Happ I touched on this the last time Wisconsin played Illinois. Happ is one of those guys who will take over a game and beat a team on his own. Happ leads Wisconsin in points per game (18.4), rebounds per game (10.5), and assists per game (4.8). As Happ goes, so goes Wisconsin.  However, as Wisconsin’s last two losses have shown, even Happ can’t always carry this team to a victory. If Illinois hopes to win its second huge matchup on the road, Happ must be accounted for on all possessions. Illinois severely limited Happ in their matchup in Champaign. A repeat of that defensive performance could bode well for what seems to be an entirely different Illinois squad. Nate Reuvers ...The ...

Ohio State: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly
The Illini made it four in a row Thursday at Ohio State. The Good Giorgi B. - on both ends! We all knew Giorgi could score, which he did again on Thursday night (13 points on 6-of-9 shooting), but who knew he could play a little defense too? He has had some good possessions here and there this season, but overall he hasn’t been a rim protector (not that we thought he would be).  On Thursday, he finished the game with a career-high four blocks and really impressed on the defensive end of the floor. In addition, he had seven boards, three of which came on the offensive end. Nice work, Giorgi.  Now, he did have some bad shots, but going 6-of-9 is still pretty darn efficient. I’ll give him some leeway on that.    Giorgi Bezhanishvili pic.twitter.com/ZIkn1TIKg9 — IllinoisLoyalty (@IllinoisLoyalty) February 15, 2019 Grinding it out down the stretch A big reason Illinois was 4-14 in conference last year was the team’s inability to finish games.

Ayo Dosunmu NBA Draft Comps
Ayo is a first round draft pick in our hearts. It’s premature. I know.  But for the first time in a long time the University of Illinois is going to have someone selected in the NBA Draft . Whether it’s this summer, next summer, or some summer after that, Ayo Dosunmu will be the first Illini Basketball player drafted since Meyers Leonard in 2012.  First and foremost, I’m an Illinois Basketball fan, so I’m going to soak up as much Ayo in the Orange and Blue as I can, while I can. But I’m also a huge NBA fan, so I’m excited at the prospect of having a new Illini in the league. And I absolutely love Dosunmu’s game and some of my favorite guys to watch in the league have a similar makeup. Ayo Dosunmu Ideally, Ayo would be a lead guard at the next level. His vision and playmaking for himself and others is his most unique and valuable offensive attribute. Combine that with his length and speed and he has the opportunity to be a formidable two-way player who can guard three positions, get out and run, initiate offense and play off of other creators. If ...

Ohio State Scouting Report
The resurgent Buckeyes and the vastly improving Illini have a lot to play for in this one . Ohio State and Illinois square off in Columbus on Thursday night. Both squads have found their groove after a tumultuous middle of the season. So, the winner of this Valentine’s Night showdown will be primed to hit the home stretch of the Big Ten schedule with plenty of momentum.  The Buckeyes prevailed in the first matchup Quinn Harris-USA TODAY Sports The Illini and Buckeyes met in December at the United Center. At the time, the Buckeyes looked like the more cohesive veteran unit while the Illini freshman duo of Ayo Dosunmu and Giorgi Bezhanishvili still did not have its sea legs under them.  Despite the freshman duo’s struggles, the Illini went into the half up 38-34, but the Buckeyes heated up in the second half as Kaleb Wesson and Keyshawn Woods took control of the game. Ohio State won 77-67. What have the Buckeyes done since the December matchup  Following the December win against the Illini, Ohio State won three in row, including another victory in the United Center against UCLA in the CBS Sports Classic. Then things got ...

Giorgi named Big Ten Player of the Week
Ayo also takes the Freshman honor.  Illinois’ good week keeps getting better. After home wins over Michigan State and Rutgers, the Illini are taking home some weekly hardware — and making history in the process. Freshman forward Giorgi Bezhanishvili was named Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday, while fellow freshman guard Ayo Dosunmu took home Big Ten Freshmen of the Week honors. We’ll pass on how Giorgi is named the best player but not the best freshman, but the duo made the Illini the first team with two freshman claiming the awards in the same week. Ever.  Pretty, pretty good.  And that’s how Giorgi has been too.  Bezhanishvili scored a freshman-record 35 points for the Illini in Saturday’s overtime win over Rutgers, making 14 shots and scoring the most points for Illinois since Malcolm Hill ’s 40 in 2016. He also added 16 points and a team-high five rebounds against the Spartans last Tuesday.  Over the three games at home, Giorgi’s brother, Davit, was visiting the states, and you can be sure that was some added motivation for the freshman from Rustavi, Georgia.  Dosunmu continued his excellent stretch of games in conference play ...
