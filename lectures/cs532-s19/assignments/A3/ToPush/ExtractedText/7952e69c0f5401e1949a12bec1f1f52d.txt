Today on The Ed Morrissey Show (4 pm ET), we have another great lineup for the news of the day! The show will be streamed on Hot Air’s Facebook page  and embedded here and on the show page for those who are not on Facebook.
Join us as we welcome:
Duane “Generalissimo” Patterson brings us up to date on the week’s top stories and gives us a preview of tomorrow’s Hugh Hewitt show. Did Andrew McCabe try to foment a coup after James Comey got fired? Will Donald Trump sign the new spending bill that will pass Congress sometime tonight? William Barr got confirmed by the Senate this afternoon; what does that mean for Robert Mueller’s investigation? We’ll discuss all this and more!
A new and revamped form of the TEMS chat room is on its way! We’ll get an update from Cranky T-Rex and talk about his movie reviews, as well as a few I’ve seen myself lately. Can You Ever Forgive Me is surprisingly engaging.
The Ed Morrissey Show and its dynamic chatroom can be seen on the permanent TEMS page . Be sure to join us, and don’t forget to keep up with the debate on my Facebook page , too!
How can Republicans and conservatives keep winning after 2016? Find out in  GOING RED , published in April from Crown Forum!
