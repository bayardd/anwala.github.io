CHICAGO, Ill. – On the first day of action at the 2019 University Athletic Association championships, the Brandeis University Swimming and Diving team set four school records and sent a pair of swimmers to the evening's final sessions.
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL RECORD
The day's first school record came in the first individual race of the day for the men. Sophomore Daniel Wohl (Chapel Hill, N.C./East Chapel Hill) knocked two seconds of the 500-yard freestyle mark that had stood since 2015 with a time of 4:39.30 in the preliminaries.
It represented a five-second improvement from Wohl's best time of the season previously and put him into the 'C' Final as the 19th overall seed.
Wohl then lowered his record once again in the finals by another two-and-a-half seconds to 4:36.85 in the finals, placing third in his heat and 19th overall.
OTHER FINALIST
Also reaching the evening session was junior Tamir Zitelny (Syosset, N.Y./Syosset) in the 50-yard freestyle.
In the prelims, Zitelny posted the 11th fastest time with a mark of 21.19 seconds, 0.15 off the school record that has stood since 2004. 
In the finals, he finished in 12th place overall, swimming 21.21 seconds.
RELAY RECORDS
During the evening's four relays, the Judges set three school records, two for the men, one for the women.
The men set the first record of the session in the 200-yard freestyle relay, with the team of Wohl, sophomore Marcelo Ohno-Machado (San Diego, Calif./Torrey Pines), sophomore Chase Chen (Villanova, Pa./The Hill School) and Zitelny shaving 0.07 off their own record set earlier this year with a time of 1:25.03, good for seventh place overall.
The women set their record in their final race of the day, the 400-yard medley relay, with a team of rookies swimming 4:01.50, good for eighth place.  Claire Xu (East Hanover, N.J./Newark Academy),  Olivia Stebbins (Willington, Conn. / Edwin O. Smith), Gazelle Umbay (North Hills, Calif. / Sierra Canyon School) and Lauren Howard (Abington, Mass. / Cardinal Spellman) erased the oldest relay records on the books for the women by three-quarters of a second. The mark had stood since 2009.
The men followed suit with their best finish of the meet, placing sixth in the 400 medley relay with a time of 3:27.52, topping Case Western Reserve by just under a second for sixth. This squad was made up of Zitelny, rookie Brendan Lu (Basking Ridge, N.J. / Ridge), junior  Matthew Arcemont (Santa Ana, Calif./Mater Dei) and Wohl and took down a record set at last year's UAAs.
