Immigration hawks are flagging major concerns about the border deal reached by Congress to avoid a second partial government shutdown, multiple experts and former immigration enforcement officials tell The Daily Caller.
The concerns center on broader protections for illegal immigrants within the U.S. and the expansion of the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program.
“More kids will be smuggled, more kids will be molested, more kids will die” as a result of the expanded protections for illegal immigrants, former Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan told The Daily Caller.
The nearly 1,200-page bill was released Wednesday in the midnight hours and will be voted on Thursday by the House of Representatives. The bill is the result of a conference committee chaired by Democrats and Republicans with a mandate to deliver funding for President Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S. southern border and avoid another partial government shutdown.
