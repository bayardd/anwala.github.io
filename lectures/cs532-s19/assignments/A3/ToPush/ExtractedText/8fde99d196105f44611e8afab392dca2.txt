Following are convenient links where readers can findÂ seeds and complete brackets for all 32 of this weekend's NJSIAA district wrestling tournaments.
Once you've entered the district of your choice, click on the word BRACKET in the drop down menu.
After clicking on the word BRACKET, use another drop down menu labeled WEIGHT CLASS and select the weight class you want to peruse. Then click the word VIEW to see the bracket for that weight class.
The brackets can be viewed on a mobile device but are best viewed on a desktop computer.
