Three players scored in double figures for Eustis and several Sentinel Super Six girls basketball teams tumbled Thursday at the onset of region tournament play.
The Panthers (16-8), who trailed by seven points to start the fourth quarter at Rockledge (18-11), rallied in the final minutes for a 58-55 win in a Class 6A, Region 4 quarterfinal.
Eustis took its first lead of the night at 54-52 when senior Kadaria Walker drained a 3-pointer from the wing with less than two minutes to play.
“There was a swing in momentum as soon as she knocked down that 3, and the girls were ready to turn around and play some defense,” said third-year Eustis coach Miranda Smith. “We were able to get some big stops there at the end.”
Walker finished with 10 points in the win. Kalea Rainey led the way with 20 points and Cerina Rolle added 16 points.

The Panthers are on the road Tuesday for a region semifinal at Bishop Moore, who defeated visiting Palm Bay 46-36. Eustis dropped three games to the Hornets this season, including last week’s district-title outing by a 65-46 score.
“They’re just a really solid team that consistently knocks down the 3-pointer,” Smith said of Bishop Moore. “We’ll be working on rebounding and contesting all those shots around the perimeter throughout the entire game and not just in spurts.”
Eustis at Bishop Moore is among a number of district rematches scheduled for the second round next week.
Wekiva, ranked No. 5 in the Super Six, got 18 points and 10 rebounds from Sedayjah Payne while pulling out a 56-44 win at No. 2 Timber Creek. The win sets up a district final rematch with rival West Orange.
The Warriors, ranked No. 3, defeated visiting Colonial 45-37 in Class 9A, Region 1.
Also in 9A-1, No. 8 Seminole suffered a lopsided setback 50-28 to Jacksonville Sandalwood while No. 10 Lake Mary lost in the final seconds 49-48 at Port Orange Spruce Creek.
No. 11 Oak Ridge and No. 12 Dr. Phillips won quarterfinal openers to set up a district rematch in 9A, Region 2.
Oak Ridge, which reached the state final four last season, relied on 24 points and 10 rebounds from Anijah Grant in a 47-32 win over Sarasota Riverview. DP won 35-23 at Lithia Newsome.
