Facebook App: Open links in External Browser
There is a specific issue with the Facebook in-app browser intermittently making requests to websites without cookies that had previously been set. This appears to be a defect in the browser which should be addressed soon. The simplest approach to avoid this problem is to continue to use the Facebook app but not use the in-app browser. This can be done through the following steps:
Open the settings menu by clicking the hamburger menu in the top right
Choose “App Settings” from the menu
Turn on the option “Links Open Externally” (This will use the device’s default browser)
