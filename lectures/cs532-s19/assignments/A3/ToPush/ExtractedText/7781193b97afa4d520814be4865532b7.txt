WASHINGTON â President Donald Trump plans to sign the proposed government funding bill but will also declare a national emergency to try to get a border wall built, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday.
McConnell: Trump to declare emergency to get border wall funding
White House confirmed Trump would sign Congressional funding bill
Bill provides for fraction of funding Trump wanted for border wall
"I've just had the opportunity to speak with the President Trump. And I would say to all my colleagues that he indicated that he is prepared to sign the bill. He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time," McConnell said.
The Senate passed the $333 billion spending bill 83-16 Thursday afternoon. Senators from Florida, Texas, California, Kentucky, New York were split on the vote. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis voted yes, while Sen. Richard Burr was back in North Carolina for a funeral and did not vote. Senators from Ohio and Wisconsin all voted yes.
Just after 9 p.m. EST the House of Representatives passed the bill with a 300-128 vote, sending it on to the president's desk.
The White House confirmed that Trump would sign the bill but it said he would also take "executive action."
"President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action â including a national emergency â to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.
The emergency declaration would shift federal funds to the border, but it's widely expected to be challenged in court.
CNN reported that it would add to the 31 other active emergency declarations . 
The congressional funding bill provides for $1.4 billion for 55 additional miles of a border barrier with Mexico â a fraction of the $5.7 billion in funding that Trump has wanted to construct 200 miles of wall.
During the Senate's opening prayer Thursday, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said, "Let's all pray that the president will have wisdom to sign the bill so the government doesn't shut down."
