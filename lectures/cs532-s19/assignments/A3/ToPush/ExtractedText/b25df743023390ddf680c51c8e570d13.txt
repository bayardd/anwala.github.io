Faribault freshman gymnast Lauren McDonough is off to state.
Competing at Thursday’s Section 2A meet in Waconia, McDonough placed fourth in balance beam to qualify for the Class A state individual meet.
“She was the very last one (to compete) in the very last event. So we talked to the judges just to see what they thought,” said Faribault coach Larissa Rasmussen. “They said she was very, very clean. She doesn’t have a lot of execution deductions.”
Taryn Sellner of Mankato West won beam at 9.6.
McDonough qualified for state three years after her older sister and FHS graduate, Maria, last competed at state.
The top three all-around finishers at each section meet advance to state. The three next highest scores per event also qualify.
The top team per section qualifies for state.
Faribault placed sixth out of nine teams and reached its goal of scoring 127 or higher by finishing at 127.2. Part of the goal was to score 31 or higher in beam, which was met at 31.125.
The Class A state meet is 11 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 23 at Maturi Pavilion on the University of Minnesota campus.
