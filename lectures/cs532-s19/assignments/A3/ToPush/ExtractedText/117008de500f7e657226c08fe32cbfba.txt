The Philippine Football Federation (PFF) has called up 23 players that comprise the squad for the Philippine Under-22 team that will compete in the AFF U22 Championship 2019 to be held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia from 17-26 February 2019.
The Philippines are in Group A together with Vietnam, Thailand, and Timor Leste.
The players called up come primarily from the university teams that participate in either the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) or the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) with a few coming from overseas based teams and Philippine professional club teams.
The head coach is Salvador Salvacion assisted by Coaches Andres Gonzales, Randolfo Clarino, Christopher Pedimonte, and Ralph Datoy. The team had training sessions and played against local clubs as build-up for the tournament.
The Under-22 team will be also form part of the Philippines team for the AFC U23 Championship 2020 Qualifiers this March in Malaysia and hopefully the squad for the 30th Southeast Asian Games which will be held this November in Manila.
