The stories of those whose lives have been devastated by our dysfunctional immigration system must be told. Too often, only one side of the issue has the focus of the media, with the illegal immigrants almost always portrayed as empathetic figures.
As the Herald’s Joe Dwinell reports, there are real victims and one of them is Maureen Maloney. Her son, 23-year-old Matthew Denice, was killed in 2011 by an Ecuadorian illegal immigrant who was convicted of motor vehicle homicide and manslaughter and is now serving 12 to 14 years.
Maloney said her son Matthew was an “amazing, kind and caring person,” breaking down as she spoke, briefly unable to continue.
That illegal immigrant should not have been here. Maloney and others have stories to tell and are doing just that in Washington D.C., this week. It is time we listen to the grieving mothers, fathers and other loved ones who’ve been victimized by illegal immigration.
