However, La Cañada looked to face its biggest test of the postseason Thursday, when it took to the road for a quarterfinal contest against Walnut.
It’s safe to say the Spartans passed the test with flying colors, jumping out to an early lead and rolling to another fine performance in a 50-37 victory.

It was the fourth quarterfinal appearance in the last five seasons for La Cañada under longtime coach Tom Hofman.
The win also puts the Spartans (26-5) into the semifinals for the first time since 2014 when it fell to neighbor St. Francis, 56-53, in Division III-A competition.
In Saturday’s semifinal at 7 p.m., La Cañada will be on the road to take on Crean Lutheran (16-9), which placed second in the Empire League.
The Spartans wasted little time putting the pressure on the host Mustangs. La Cañada used a substantial 15-0 run in the first quarter to close out the frame with an 11-point advantage, 20-9.
It was more of the same in the second quarter for the Spartans and they went into halftime leading, 29-14.
In the third quarter, Walnut was able to whittle the Spartans’ lead to 11 in the opening minutes. But Kyle Brown (12 points) responded with back-to-back three-pointers to expand the lead to 37-20.
La Cañada, which received 13 points from Ryan Graves, went into the fourth quarter with a 39-26 cushion.
The Spartans began the playoffs with a 57-43 first-round victory against Burbank before dispatching La Mirada, 65-36, in the second round.
Walnut (23-8) was runner-up in the Hacienda League behind Los Altos.
