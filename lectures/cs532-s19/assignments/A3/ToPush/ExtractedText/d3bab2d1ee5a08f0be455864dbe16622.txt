Jupiter, Florida police have charged billionaire Robert Kraft, the o...wner of the New England Patriots and a top Trump ally, supporter, and friend, with soliciting prostitution.  Describing Kraft as "one of the most powerful men in American football," Deadspin reports he "was charged today on two counts of soliciting prostitution in connection to a recent law enforcement bust on massage parlors in Florida that, according to law enforcement, were used for prostitution and human trafficking. The news comes a few weeks after the Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl and days after Kraft appeared at the NBA All-Star game." Kraft, reportedly worth about $6.6 billion, is close to President Donald Trump. When Kraft's wife died, he says Trump "called me once a week for the whole year, the most depressing year of my life when I was down and out." See More
