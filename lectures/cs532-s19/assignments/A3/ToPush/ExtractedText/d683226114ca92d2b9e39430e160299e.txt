Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wants the president and speaker to play nice.
The feud between President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the partial government shutdown reached new levels this week when Pelosi essentially uninvited the president from delivering the State of the Union in the House Chamber. Trump, in turn, barred Pelosi from boarding a government plane for a trip to Afghanistan just under an hour before she was scheduled to leave.

“Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative,” Trump wrote.
Each side cited the government shutdown in foiling the other’s plans. Pelosi argued it would not be possible to secure the Capitol when so many federal workers are going unpaid. Trump said it would be “inappropriate” for Pelosi to travel with no deal to end the shutdown in sight.
But Graham said both sides were just being petty.
“One sophomoric response does not deserve another,” Graham wrote Thursday on Twitter . “Speaker Pelosi’s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political. ... President Trump denying Speaker Pelosi military travel to visit our troops in Afghanistan, our allies in Egypt and NATO is also inappropriate.”
Graham, who has been a vocal Trump supporter, has diverged from the president’s agenda recently. In addition to Trump blocking Pelosi’s travel plans, the president’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria also garnered a criticism from Graham that has been uncharacteristic since the 2016 election.
