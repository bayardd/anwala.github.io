Plane manufacturer Airbus announced it would be abandoning the production of the A380 superjumbo due to lackluster sales.
According to Reuters.com , Airbus officials said the last A380 would be delivered in 2021, with the decision coming after Emirates reduced its orders for the massive plane, causing the manufacturer to evaluate the project as a result of the drop in demand.

With the closure of the A380 production, an estimated 3,000-3,500 jobs could potentially be impacted, especially at factories in France , Germany, Spain and Britain. Enders said the company could not guarantee all would keep their jobs.
“This was a joint decision,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders told Reuters. “We cannot run after illusions and we have to take the only sensible decision and stop this program.”
The world’s largest airliner was initially designed to challenge Boeing’s 747 planes, but Airbus failed to take hold as airlines backed a new generation of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. In total, Airbus will produce 17 more of the planes, including 14 for Emirates and three for Japanese airline All Nippon Airways.
While the A380 is shutting down, Emirates placed a new order for 40 Airbus A330-900neo planes and 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft. Despite the closure of the program, Airbus said it would support the A380 as long as it remains in service.
