President Trump is speaking out against new Democrat obstruction, with the threat of another government shutdown looming. He took to Twitter Monday, saying “Democrats do not want us to detain or send back criminal aliens.”
The Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!

Over the weekend, negotiations hit a snag after Democrats pushed to add restrictions to ICE detentions. They also still refuse to put forward $5.7 billion for the border wall.
Several lawmakers, including Mark Meadows and Liz Cheney, are saying a shutdown is avoidable if Democrats come to the table. Meadows said with no real options on the table, the president could declare an emergency to fund a border barrier.

“I do expect the president to take some kind of executive action, a national emergency is certainly part of that, there are a few other things in his toolbox that he could use, but I do expect him to do that if we don’t reach a compromise,” said Representative Meadows.
Congressional lawmakers will meet Monody to resume border security talks. Lawmakers have until Friday to come to an agreement to avoid another shutdown.
