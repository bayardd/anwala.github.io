Government Shutdown Relief for CBP Families
$200 of $100,000 goal
  Community   ATLANTA, GA
As the government shutdown has just passed the 30-day mark, it has come to our attention that many of the families of the 800,000+ government employees that have not received paychecks are struggling to provide the bare essentials (groceries, diapers, gas for vehicles, etc.).
In an effort to come alongside our fellow citizens that are struggling during this difficult time, Food Aid International will be providing Grocery Store Gift Cards and Gas Station Gift Cards to Customs & Border Protection (CBP) Families impacted by the shutdown.
There are over 26,000 CBP agents that are currently working full time to protect and serve the citizens of the United States, but they are doing so without a paycheck until the government shutdown is over. While most banks and mortgage companies have provided temporary relief for these government employees, many are struggling to simply afford the bare essentials like groceries, diapers, prescription drugs and fuel for vehicles.
It is unthinkable to allow CBP agents to struggle to feed their families as they continue to serve the citizens of the United States on a daily basis!
All contributions to this fund will be used to provide Grocery Store Gift Cards and Gas Station Gift Cards directly to Customs & Border Protection Families impacted during this time.
Will you come alongside these heroes in providing groceries and fuel for their families as they continue to keep America safe?
We are partnering with some incredible local nonprofits and faith-based organizations serving the CBP community. We will be introducing the names of our partner organizations that will be assisting in distribution of the Gift Cards over the next couple of days!
