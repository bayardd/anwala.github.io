21 Savage has been released from ICE custody on bond, but there’s a possibility he may still be deported because of Donald Trump.
TMZ reports that ICE planned to arrest 21 months ago once discovering his past conviction, which was unknowingly sealed and vacated. However, the ICE agents in Washington, D.C. were well aware his conviction was sealed and decided to double down and demanded that he was held without bond. Now that he’s out, awaiting his ICE hearing, and has a pending visa which was filed in 2017, he may still have to leave the country.
Trump reversed the immigration policies of both former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush which orders are to deport people who have a pending visa application, even if they meet all requirements, and they can come back if and when it’s approved.
21 Savage has yet to publicly comment on his arrest since his release.
