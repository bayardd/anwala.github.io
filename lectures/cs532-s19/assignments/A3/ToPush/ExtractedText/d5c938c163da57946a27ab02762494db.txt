As a former Texas prosecutor, Sidney Powell has seen some of the disturbing consequences of bad immigration policy. She offers insights into the current border issues facing President Trump, border security and the prospects of a national emergency.
Powell sees loopholes in the U.S. immigration system that she believes encourage child trafficking and help feed drug cartels millions of dollars. She explores how the ease of fraudulent asylum claims, activist judges, caravans, an overwhelming backlog of immigration cases, as well as diversionary tactics and what she calls trojan horses, as contributing to a broken system in desperate need of reform.
To deal with this, Powell encourages harsh medicine: a temporary halt to all immigration while the Administration can bring everything under control.
