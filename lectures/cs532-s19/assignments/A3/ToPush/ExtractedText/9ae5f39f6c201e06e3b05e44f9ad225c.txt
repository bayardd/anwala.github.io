The US President will sign a government funding bill to fund his controversial wall, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Ms Sanders said: “The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.”
Mr Trump will sign a border security bill to avoid a government shutdown after warning his wall was “very, very on the way”.
But he will also bypass Congress and use military funds to build his US-Mexico border wall.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell announced Mr Trump’s  plan on Thursdsay before voting on a compromise bill.
The bi-partisan legislation includes £1bn ($ 1.3bn) for border security, but doesn’t specifically divert funds for Mr Trump’s wall.
It would provide more than £234 billion ($ 300 billion) to fund the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies until September 30, the end of the current fiscal year.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, warned Democrats could challenge the president’s emergency declaration.
She said: “”We will review our options and prepare to respond to it.
“I know the Republicans have some unease about it, no matter what they say.
“If the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an ’emergency’, an illusion that he wants to convey, then think of what a president with different values can present to the American people.”
 
Mr Trump triggered a 35-day goverment shutdown after his December demand for $ 5.7 billion to help build a portion of the wall.
In denying him that money, Congress preventd Mr Trump from carrying out one of his key 2016 campaign pledges.
Earlier, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer called the spending legislation agreement a “reasonable compromise.”
Mr Schumer said: “It does not fund the president’s wall, but it does support smart border security initiatives that both parties have always supported. Most importantly, it will keep our government open.”
