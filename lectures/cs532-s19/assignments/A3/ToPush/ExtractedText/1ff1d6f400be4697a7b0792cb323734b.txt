About
Trumpbert is a parody of the Dilbert comic strip, satirizing Dilbert creator Scott Adams’ baffling support for Donald Trump, the quintessential pointy-haired boss.
Trumpbert launched on September 17, 2018, and runs five days a week, Monday through Friday, with weekly and monthly bonus  strips for select supporters .
Trumpbert is written by Freeman Ng, a former Google software engineer now happily  writing  and creating digital art .
The illustrator has chosen anonymity (for now) but you can read more about our working arrangement on the  Patreon page .
