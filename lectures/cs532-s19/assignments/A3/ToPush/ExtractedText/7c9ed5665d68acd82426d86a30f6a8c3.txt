The thought was that Derel Walker was either going to go to the B.C. Lions with quarterback Mike Reilly or return to the Edmonton Eskimos.
Nobody was guessing Toronto Argos or any other team in the league for the former CFL Award-winner as Most Outstanding rookie and a receiver who put up 4,208 yards receiving in 49 games in four seasons despite missing time due to an NFL look and injury. He is reportedly getting just under $300,000 on a one-year deal with Toronto.
Walker Thursday joined a list of ex-Eskimos including free agent departing Mike Reilly, Aaron Grymes, Chris Edwards and Josh Woodman. The team also lost Duke Williams, Jake Ceresna, Mercy Maston to the NFL and J.C. Sherritt to retirement.
“We made several offers including right after we found out he wasn’t going to have knee surgery,” said general manager Brock Sunderland of Walker.
“We were just very far apart. Offers were made. There were a couple of counters. The reality was we were significantly far apart.
“That said we are just thrilled we have Greg Ellingson. We think we have another premier wide receiver and we couldn’t be happier that we have Greg.”
