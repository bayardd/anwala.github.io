Pressured by local and national media, Omar soon released a statement. It failed to address much of the evidence . Her statement included this passage:
In 2002, when I was 19 years old, Ahmed Hirsi … and I, applied for a marriage license, but we never finalized the application and thus were never legally married. In 2008, we decided to end our relationship in our faith tradition after reaching an impasse in our life together.
I entered into a relationship with a British citizen, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, and married him legally in 2009. Our relationship ended in 2011 and we divorced in our faith tradition. …
Since 2011, I am happy to say that I have reconciled with Ahmed Hirsi, we have married in our faith tradition and are raising our family together. (Emphasis added)
----------------------------
I have extensively searched publicly available address records with the assistance of a legal researcher. We have found that Rep. Omar’s first claim -- that she and Ahmed Hirsi underwent an Islamic divorce “to end [their] relationship” in 2008 -- can not be reconciled with their official address records. Further, her claim can not be reconciled with her own words from an interview she gave in 2013.
-- From 2002 until 2009, Ilhan Omar lived in a series of apartments in Minneapolis with Ahmed Hirsi.
-- In 2009, Ilhan Omar married British citizen Ahmed Nur Said Elmi.
-- In August 2009, records show that both Ilhan Omar and Ahmed Nur Said Elmi left Minnesota, moving to 2608 Pacific Dr. South, Apt. 4, Fargo, North Dakota 58103. (The record we found for Elmi did not include the apartment number.)
-- However, records show that Ahmed Hirsi moved there, too.
In August 2009, Ahmed Hirsi is recorded at 2608 Pacific Dr. South, Apt. 4, Fargo, North Dakota 58103.
Ilhan, her Islamically divorced first husband, and her second husband are all recorded to live at the same apartment at the same time.
-- In February 2010, both Ilhan Omar and Ahmed Hirsi are recorded as having moved to 2438 18th St. South, Fargo, North Dakota 58103.
-- Records show that Ahmed Elmi, her legal husband, appears at this new address in November 2010, nine months later.
