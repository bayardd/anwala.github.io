Feb. 12, 2019
Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

• The border deal came together just before President Trump was about to begin a campaign and “Finish the Wall” rally in El Paso . In a bit of political theater, Beto O’Rourke was holding his own rally less than a mile away.
• Critics called Hillary Clinton “shrill” and “unlikable” in 2016. It’s no coincidence that the same words are being used against Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris as they campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Here’s how sexism plays out on the campaign trail .
• Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota apologized for insinuating that American support for Israel is fueled by money from a pro-Israel lobby group — a comment that drew condemnation from fellow Democrats .
• In Iowa, Senator Cory Booker pledged to restore “grace and decency,” while Senator Elizabeth Warren vowed to “fight my heart out.” The two Democratic presidential candidates present voters with a philosophical choice between reuniting a divided country or crushing Mr. Trump and his party .
• A Virginia state legislator intended to begin impeachment proceedings against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax over accusations of sexual assault, but backed down after African-American lawmakers demanded there not be a rush to oust Mr. Fairfax .
• In a move that challenges Mr. Trump’s warnings of a national security crisis, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, announced that he would withdraw nearly 400 of his state’s National Guard troops from the U.S.-Mexico border .
• The Trump administration is pressuring Iraq to stop buying energy from Iran, its sole foreign supplier, but Iraqi leaders are resisting because they fear power shortfalls and mass protests .
• City officials in Sandusky, Ohio, voted to swap the Columbus Day holiday with one on Election Day. The move was intended to affirm the city’s values, but it also inserted it into two contentious national debates .
• Cliff Sims, the former White House communications aide who wrote an insider account about working for Mr. Trump, is suing the president in his official capacity, alleging that he used his campaign organization to keep former employees from invoking their First Amendment rights .
