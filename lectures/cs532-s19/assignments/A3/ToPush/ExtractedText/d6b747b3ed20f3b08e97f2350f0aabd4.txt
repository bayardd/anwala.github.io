HAZEN — Through the middle frames, the Dickinson Trinity boys basketball team and Hazen were even, but the Titans outscored the Bison 14-9 in the first and 18-14 in the fourth and went on to win 55-47 on Thursday, Feb. 14 at Bison Arena.
While both squads shot just over 46 percent on the evening, the Titans attempted four more shots than the Bison, coming away with the win.
Titans sophomore guard Cole Fitterer and Bison junior guard Garrett Ward each netted a game-high 17 points, while Dickinson Trinity senior forward Aric Knopik added 14.
The Titans committed just six fouls to Hazen’s 14, but turned the ball over 13 times, while Hazen did just on just eight occasions.
The Bison (14-6, 7-3 Region 7) were drastically outrebounded, as the Titans (15-5, 9-1 Region 7) collected 38 boards and Hazen hauled in 13. Proving his ankle injury is in the past, senior forward Isaac Fridrich paced Dickinson Trinity with seven rebounds, four on the defensive end.
