Patriots battle past GICC in C1-9 subdistrict final
Save
KEARNEY — Adams Central found a way to grind out a second win within a 24-hour period during the Class C-1, Subdistrict 9 tournament Thursday.
After beating Kearney Catholic in overtime on Wednesday, the admittedly tired Patriots held No. 5-rated Grand Island Central Catholic to a total of 12 points over the first, second and fourth quarters.
Adams Central then used some clutch shooting from freshman Jessica Babcock in the final period to claim a 35-28 victory in the championship game.
The Patriots (17-7) would have still headed to a district final even with a loss if three teams ahead of them in the wild-card points standings had also won on Thursday. But they eliminated the need for any scoreboard watching.
“We told our girls that was an afterthought,” Patriots coach Evan Smith said. “We wanted to take care of our own destiny. They took that to heart and played well tonight.”
Central Catholic (18-5) trailed 12-3 at the half after going 1-for-16 from the floor with Rylie Rice’s 3-pointer with 2:45 left in the first quarter resulting in the team’s only points.
“I think credit goes to Adams Central. I think they just played better than us tonight,” Crusaders coach Stacia Rice said. “They took us out of our strengths, and we just didn’t do the things we needed to do to win a ballgame. We can’t score three points in a half and expect to win.”
And yet Adams Central only led by nine while going 5-for-29 from the floor.
“Obviously the first half was a little stagnant offensively for both teams,” Smith said. “Both teams play really good defense. But I thought in the second half we just applied a little more pressure defensively.”
And despite that the Crusaders came out and immediately put together a 13-2 run to take a 16-14 lead. They were aided by committing one turnover in the second half after amassing 15 in the first.
“You don’t see that very often in high school basketball to hold a team to three points,” Smith said. “But they made adjustments, and they did a good job of getting it to their post players and getting to the rim.”
Senior post Megan Woods scored all seven of her points in the third quarter.
“I think we just once again had to play to our strengths (in the third quarter),” Stacia Rice said. “We just seemed really lost and out of it. We kind of had two days of that. I don’t think we played our best against Minden, and we definitely didn’t play our best right now.”
Smith said the Patriots did a good job of defending Woods and Rylie Rice, who had a game-high eight points. That played a big part in his team avenging a 45-26 loss from Jan. 19.
“We knew those two players could beat us pretty easily,” he said. “We put a lot of emphasis on what they were doing and trying to stay with them. We caused them some trouble, but they still found a way to score in the second half and make a really good game of it.”
The Crusaders led 21-18 early in the fourth quarter before Babcock hit back-to-back 3-pointers to give the Patriots the lead for good. She added a 3-point play to make it a 29-25 contest with 2:25 left and finished with 13 points. Morgan Samuelson led Adams Central with 14.
Central Catholic will look to regroup prior to the Feb. 22 district finals.
“We didn’t shoot with a lot of confidence tonight,” Stacia Rice said. “We’re going to get it fixed, and we’re going to be ready to play.”
