HARRISONBURG, Va. -- Sophomore forward Dwight Wilson erupted for 20 points and a career-high 18 rebounds to lead James Madison on Thursday evening, as the Dukes held off a charge from Drexel to pick up a 71-69 win over the Dragons in Colonial Athletic Association men's basketball at the JMU Convocation Center.
The Dukes (11-15, 4-9 CAA) pounded the ball inside throughout the contest, hitting 26 of their 41 shots (63.4 percent) from inside the three-point line, ending up with a 56.6 percent (30-of-53) clip from the field on the night and scoring 46 points in the paint to Drexel's (12-15, 6-8 CAA) 36, despite the Dragons pulling down 17 offensive rebounds.
Wilson led the charge in a career evening, going 9-of-11 from the field and dominating the paint across 34 minutes without a foul. The sophomore posted 12 points and 10 boards in the second half alone, recording his fifth double-double of the season.
Three other players joined Wilson in double figures, with senior guard Stuckey Mosley adding 15 points and sophomore guard Matt Lewis and freshman guard Deshon Parker chipping in 11 each. Parker racked up 10 in the opening period alone, adding four assists, three boards and two steals on the night.
After taking a nine-point lead into halftime, the Dukes pushed their advantage to as many as 14 in the second half, continuing to lead by a 66-54 margin with 5:14 to play.
Drexel went on a run late, however, cutting things to 69-68 with 10 seconds left before getting an offensive rebound out of bounds on an intentionally missed free throw while facing a 71-69 deficit with 0.8 seconds to play. The Dukes swallowed the ensuing in-bounds play, however, not allowing a shot attempt before the horn sounded to seal the victory.
Alihan Demir lead the way for Drexel, racking up 23 points on 10-of-19 shooting, while James Butler notched a double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds.
