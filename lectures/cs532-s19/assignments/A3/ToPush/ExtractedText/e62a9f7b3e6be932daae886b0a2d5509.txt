Undersized in the paint in every game it’s played this season, Manhattan has had to rely on the long ball.
Three-point shooting, as well as hard-nosed defense, was the plan again Thursday afternoon in the Belgrade Special Events Center. The defensive effort was there, but the offensive production never materialized.
The Tigers shot just 2 of 14 from behind the arc — one of those was a meaningless 3 that banked in at the end of the game — in a 44-35 loss to Whitehall in a first round game at the District 5B Tournament.
“They did a good job of finding our shooters and we struggled because we don’t have anything inside,” first-year Manhattan coach Wes Kragt said. “I thought defensively was good to hold them and slow the ball down. We limited (Clay) Wolfe inside and he had to really work for his baskets, but just couldn’t hit anything from the outside.”
Wolfe, a 6-foot-6 post, was limited to six points. But the senior grabbed nine rebounds and helped the Trojans control the boards, 43-24.
Manhattan (3-16) was competitive early and led 13-10 late in the first half following a fast break bucket by Jadon Pierce. The contest was knotted at 13 at halftime, and then at 20 early in the third quarter on a fast break bucket by the Tigers’ Finn Tesoro.

But the Trojans wore down Manhattan in the second half led by 6-foot-4 sophomore Hayden Hoagland, who finished with 16 points and six rebounds.
Hoagland combined with Cade Briggs, who tallied a game-high 17 points, to shoot 14 of 19 from the line.
Kyle Hotvedt led the Tigers with 13 points, but the junior briefly left the game in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. Senior Cache Douma did not play in the second half taking a hit to the head in the second quarter.
“We lost two of our older kids. I had to play a lot of young kids,” said Kragt. “But I think the thing that killed us is they shot 33 free throws and had 20 points on free throws and we have five.”
Whitehall (8-11) advanced to the semifinals and will play Three Forks Friday at 7:30 p.m. The second-seeded Wolves had a first round bye.
Manhattan will play a loser-out game Saturday morning and would need to win again in the consolation game later in the day to qualify for the divisional tournament.
“If we get hot we can put up some points,” said Kragt. “The big part is we have a day to take off and kind of game plan for that Saturday morning game. Hopefully put a good game together Saturday morning.”
