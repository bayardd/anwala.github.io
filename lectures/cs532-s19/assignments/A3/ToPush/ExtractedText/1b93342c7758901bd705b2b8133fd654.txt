Each podcast carves out, inch-by inch, a space into which the curious listener can crawl and explore from time to time. With each new conversation, the space expands, the listener reluctantly steps in, and stretches his arms as wide as they can go. He is now eager to explore, he runs as fast as he can; left, right, in circles. He's excited and exhausted, and overwhelmed, yet there is so much more to discover.  Looking back the way he came, he sees everything as it always was, but from a new perspective. He turns to look forward again, and he sees a group of people up ahead, drinking beer, having a laugh and observing the events happening outside.  Among the crowd, now growing larger as he approahces, the listener can identify the speaker. He joins the conversation and realizes he has only now acheived consciousness.

Wonderful listen, Professor Dungey and Walker work well together and cover important issues which need to be brought to light. Ignorance is not bliss - listen to these podcasts, consider its arguments and look deep within yourself to see what you can do to change the way you look at life and how you can improve yourself and the lives of others by being better informed.
