WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The words sting once they’re fully digested.
"We showed no fight,” a visibly upset Karissa McLaughlin said about 30 minutes after the Purdue women’s basketball team suffered an embarrassing 65-45 loss to Minnesota at Mackey Arena.
Those weren’t the only words McLaughlin said during a nearly three-minute interview. There were more. The “no fight” stands out for a team – and program - that usually shows plenty.

Four regular season games remain, including Sunday against Northwestern, but the Boilermakers have moved past a crossroads moment and into the desperation stage. Whatever margin for error existed before Thursday no longer is available when discussing the NCAA tournament. And winning out might not be enough.
Purdue has been playing for its NCAA lives since the calendar turned to February but hasn’t responded. A fourth-quarter meltdown at Nebraska was alarming and another dismal fourth-quarter performance is a sign the Boilermakers are headed in the wrong direction.
In fact, the Boilermakers just quietly drifted away Thursday as the Golden Gophers ran coach Sharon Versyp’s team out of their own building.
"It’s disappointing to see that," McLaughlin said. "We showed no fight. They made a run and we were down by 10 with five minutes to go. Tamara (Farquhar) brought us together and said:  'We need to make our run now. It’s our time to shine. We’ve got five minutes to attack them, we’ve got five minutes to decrease this 10- point lead.'  We did nothing." 
McLaughlin was left standing as the team’s only spokesperson after Purdue’s second 20-point loss in the last three home games. Versyp didn’t make herself available to the media, who waited for more than 45 minutes outside of the locker room. Not a good look for a coach in her 13th season with the program. 
Indeed, the Boilermakers were still within striking distance at the 4:55 mark, trailing 55-45. But for whatever reason, Purdue couldn’t generate a sense of urgency - either on the court or from the bench - to even challenge Minnesota down the stretch.
And boy, those final 10 minutes were as brutal as the numbers show.

The Boilermakers missed all 11 field goal attempts, committed eight turnovers and were outscored 20-2. The only two points – free throws by Lyndsey Whilby. All this from a team that trailed by two following McLaughlin's 3-pointer to end the third quarter. 
Meanwhile, Destiny Pitts scored 23 of her 27 points in the second half as the switch to a four-guard lineup continues to push Minnesota up the Big Ten standings. Pitts actually outscored Purdue 23-21 in the second half, adding more misery. 
The Gophers won their fifth straight game and their quickness wore down the Boilermakers.
"It’s our strength," first-year coach Lindsay Whalen said. "We’re undersized, so we’ve got to play that way. We’ve got to play quick and we’ve got to try and get in the passing lanes as much as possible and pressure and use that to our advantage." 
Right now, it’s hard to find the advantages in favor of the Boilermakers
When the perimeter game isn’t clicking, the offense struggles and can't find consistency. Purdue was 3 of 24 shooting and scored 11 points in the second and fourth quarters combined Thursday. 
If there are breakdowns on defense, opponents find the holes. When the Boilermakers don’t control the rebounding, they have little chance. 
The lack of post player development was visible Thursday. Ae’Rianna Harris is one of the top players in the Big Ten and when the junior picked up her third foul with 5:05 to play in the third quarter, the offense crum
The Boilermakers received no contributions from Fatou Diagne and Nyagoa Gony and the Gophers pounced. Granted, Diagne and Gony are still gaining experience but 27 games into the season should produce some results.
What happened? From the moment Harris went to the bench, Minnesota outscored Purdue 31-7 during the final 15 minutes. The offense folded up and disappeared. 
"I don’t think our leaders stepped up collectively," McLaughlin said. "We have five solid players that play most of the minutes and unfortunately we’re not doing our part. Regardless of what the circumstances are, whether someone is out or someone is coming in, the leaders have to step up every single night." 
Although size in the post isn’t considered the strength of the Gophers, they exploited the matchups.
"Harris is such a dynamic player," Whalen said. "We got a little more high-low and more inside when she was out. She’s a tremendous player and it’s hard to go at her when she’s in the game because she’s going to block your shot." 
Where does this leave the Boilermakers?
No one knows if Thursday was the low point of a season that was supposed to see this team comfortably in the NCAA tournament by this stage. The final three weeks would be about jockeying for seeding and placement in the tournament. It wasn’t that long ago Purdue was 6-2 in the Big Ten and part of the conversation to win the regular season title. 
Those days are gone, and now we’re left wondering how much fight this team – and this program – has left.
