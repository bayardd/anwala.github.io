With Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski looking on, the John Marshall boys basketball team continued its recent surge on Thursday night.
The host Rockets avenged an earlier loss to Northfield as they posted a 59-43 victory over the Raiders in Big Nine Conference play.
Krzyzewski visited chilly Minnesota on Valentine's Day in his pursuit of five-star recruit Matthew Hurt, who is still undecided about his college. And the 6-foot-9 senior forward delivered for the Rockets with 29 points, 15 rebounds and six assists to lead JM to its fifth straight victory.
"It means a lot," Hurt said of Krzyzewski's visit. "They're in mid-season right now so they could have better things to do, especially on Valentine's Day. So to come and watch me means a lot to me."
"That's great for Matt," JM coach Jim Daly said.
Hurt scored 17 points and had four assists in the first half as the Rockets built a 33-18 lead at the break.
It was a much different game then the first meeting between the two teams. Northfield won that contest 73-70 back on Dec. 11, which saw the Rockets slide to 0-3 at the time. During a stint that has seen JM win nine of its past 10 games, defense has been a big reason. The Rockets have allowed more than 60 points just twice in the last 10 games.
"I think our kids are doing a much better job the second half of the season playing defense," Daly said. "Scheme-wise is the same, maybe (they're) just playing a little harder and maybe understanding where they should be position-wise."
"Defense, it starts with Simon Werven," Hurt said. "He usually guards the best player on the other team,. He keeps his man in front, contests everything, is pretty strong. He's a really good track guy; I think it starts with him. I think our defense has really improved since Day One."
Werven, a 6-5 senior forward, was matched against 6-7 senior Mason Zick much of the time Thursday. Zick, who is headed to play Division II college ball at North Greenville University in South Carolina, entered the game averaging 20 points a game. But he was in foul trouble early, and was stifled on offense as well with just eight points before fouling out with 2:43 left.
With the Rockets playing sound defense, Northfield shot just 31.9 percent from the floor (15-for-47). The Raiders entered the game averaging 74.4 points a game.
"If we want to be an elite (defensive) team, it doesn't require one effort, it requires multiple efforts," Daly said.
Hurt made 11 of his 20 shots from the floor and also dished out six assists as JM shot 48.8 percent (21-for-43).
"I just have to rebound, pass and shoot, try to get other guys involved and keep the defense honest," Hurt said.
Lincoln Meister, a 6-8 junior, chipped in with 10 points and eight rebounds for the Rockets, who controlled the boards 36-21.
JM sealed the win by going 14-for-15 at the line in the second half as Meister and Werven were both 4-for-4 and Hurt was 6-for-7.
The Rockets improve to 13-6 overall and 11-4 in the Big Nine Conference. The win keeps JM's slim hopes alive of winning the Big Nine title as they pull within two games of Austin and Mankato East. The loss drops Northfield to 13-6, 9-6 in the Big Nine.
"They've got a good team and a great chance to go to state (in Class AAA)," Daly said. "It was a quality win for us."
