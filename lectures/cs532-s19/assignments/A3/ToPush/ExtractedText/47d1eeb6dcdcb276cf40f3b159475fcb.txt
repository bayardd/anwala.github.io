President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he's "not happy" with the bipartisan spending deal reached this week that falls short of his demands for border wall funds.
"I'm not happy about it. It's not doing the trick," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

Republican leaders are trying to convince Trump to sign off on the deal, which would avert a government shutdown due to start on Friday. But the president expressed displeasure with the contours of the compromise that would provide $1.375 billion in funding for a border barrier — far less than the $5.7 billion Trump had demanded.
Trump said that he’s “adding things” to the compromise deal, without specifying what he wants to add.
“I'm extremely unhappy with what the Democrats have given us. It's sad,” the president said, striking a starkly pessimistic tone, even as GOP leaders have touted the compromise as a solid deal.

He told reporters that he “would hope” that there will not be another shutdown, but he didn’t rule out the possibility. “I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown,” he said. “If you did have it, it's the Democrats' fault.”
He also did not rule out that he could declare a national emergency to secure border wall funds if Congress sends him a deal he doesn’t like. “I’m considering everything,” he said.
